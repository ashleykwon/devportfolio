        <h2>Bi-sociation Generator Using a Knowledge Graph Structure</h2>
        <p>
            Arthur Koestler, in his 1964 book, The Act of Creation, discusses the term “bi-sociation”, 
            which is a process of finding connections between two seemingly unrelated contexts.
              Koestler claims that this discovery is the basis of creative acts.
               Drawing inspiration from bi-sociation, poly-association is a term that Prof. Bill Seaman coined. 
            It refers to the process of associating two more contexts to find connections among them. 
            <br><br>
            As a member of Prof. Bill Seaman’s Insight Engine team, 
            I collaboratively designed an interface with another Duke undergraduate student to visualize 
            the poly-association process. The model has an underlying graph structure represented below, 
            where a node represents a concept related to philosophy or 18th-19th century French politics and art. 
            A directed edge between two nodes explains how those two concepts are related. 
            In the poly-association interface, the user can choose two or more concepts to visualize their relationships. 
            The backend algorithm of the interface finds the shortest path between every possible pair 
            of chosen concepts and visualizes values of all nodes and edges in the path on the 
            right-hand side of the interface. 
            <br><br>
            I presented this interface at the Theoretical and Foundational Problems in Information Studies conference,
             introducing its participants to a novel way of visualizing poly-associations in a digital platform. My presentation linked here and my extended abstract linked here describe the interface in more detail.
            <br><br>
            Learning about ways to bridge concepts from multiple disciplines through this project, 
            I was inspired to continue to find connections among different academic topics and to 
            create interdisciplinary research ideas.
